            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p><b>Plan²-</b> This site name was chosed because I needed a plan to plan to plan my website. My original <i>plan</i> was "Plan Plan", but then there was a change of <i>plans</i> and I changed it to "Plan²".</p>
            <p>Because '²' is an unusual character, it would most likely be replaced with the number 2 for things like the domain name, were it to ever actually get one.</p>
